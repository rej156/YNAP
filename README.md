# YNAP

I've decided to do it in a MobX + Next.js stack.

Given more time, I'd fix the isomorphic issues but it satisfies the requirements nonetheless!

Could not find the path or json payload for deleting an item via experimentation in Postman but I still did it clientside.

I did try using '{ id: 1 }'/'{ ID: 1 }' on /product, /products, /product/1! 

```
- [ ] yarn
- [ ] npm start

```
